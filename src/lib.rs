//! # ðŸ’‹ SM â€“ a static State Machine library
//!
//! SM aims to be a **safe**, **fast** and **simple** macro-based state machine
//! library.
//!
//! * **safe** â€” the type system, move semantics and exhaustive pattern matching
//!   prevent you from mis-using your state machines
//!
//! * **fast** â€” near-zero runtime overhead, all validation is done at
//!   compile-time
//!
//! * **simple** â€” one declarative macro, control-flow only, no business logic
//!   attached
//!
//! Using this library, you declaratively define your state machines as as set
//! of states, connected via transitions, triggered by events. You can query
//! the current state of the machine, or pattern match all possible states.
//!
//! The implementation ensures a zero-sized abstraction that uses Rust's
//! type-system and ownership model to guarantee valid transitions between
//! states using events, and makes sure previous states are no longer accessible
//! after transitioning away to another state. Rust validates correct usage of
//! the state machine at compile-time, no runtime checking occurs when using the
//! library.
//!
//! The library exposes the `sm!` macro, which allows you to declaratively build
//! the state machine.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### Quick Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//!
//! sm! {
//!     Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//!
//!     TurnKey {
//!         Locked => Unlocked
//!         Unlocked => Locked
//!     }
//!
//!     Break {
//!         Locked => Broken
//!         Unlocked => Broken
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     use Lock::*;
//!     let sm = Machine::new(Locked);
//!     let sm = sm.event(TurnKey);
//!
//!     assert_eq!(sm.state(), Unlocked);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Descriptive Example
//!
//! The below example explains step-by-step how to create a new state machine
//! using the provided macro, and then how to use the created machine in your
//! code by querying states, and transitioning between states by triggering
//! events.
//!
//! #### Declaring a new State Machine
//!
//! First, we import the macro from the crate:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! ```
//!
//! Next, we initiate the macro declaration:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! sm! {
//! # Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Then, provide a name for the machine, and declare its states:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//!     Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, we declare one or more events and the associated transitions:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//!     TurnKey {
//!         Locked => Unlocked
//!         Unlocked => Locked
//!     }
//!
//!     Break {
//!         Locked => Broken
//!         Unlocked => Broken
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And we're done. We've defined our state machine structure, and the valid
//! transitions, and can now use this state machine in our code.
//!
//! #### Using your State Machine
//!
//! You can initialise the machine as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! let sm = Lock::Machine::new(Lock::Locked);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! We can make this a bit less verbose by bringing our machine into scope:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! use Lock::*;
//! let sm = Machine::new(Locked);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! We've initialised our machine in the `Locked` state. You can get the current
//! state of the machine by sending the `state()` method to the machine:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! # use Lock::*;
//! # let sm = Machine::new(Locked);
//! let state = sm.state();
//! assert_eq!(state, Locked);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! While you _can_ use `sm.state()` with conditional branching to execute your
//! code based on the current state, this can be a bit tedious, it's less
//! idiomatic, and it prevents you from using one extra compile-time validation
//! tool in our toolbox: using Rust's exhaustive pattern matching requirement to
//! ensure you've covered all possible state variants in your business logic.
//!
//! While `sm.state()` returns the state as a unit-like struct (which itself is
//! a [ZST], or Zero Sized Type), you can use the `sm.as_enum()` method to get
//! the state machine wrapped in an enum type.
//!
//! [ZST]:
//! https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts
//!
//! Using the enum type and pattern matching, you are able to do the following:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! # use Lock::*;
//! # let sm = Machine::new(Locked);
//! # let state = sm.state();
//! match sm.as_enum() {
//!     States::Locked(m) => assert_eq!(m.state(), Locked),
//!     States::Unlocked(m) => assert_eq!(m.state(), Unlocked),
//!     States::Broken(m) =>  assert_eq!(m.state(), Broken),
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The compiler won't be satisfied until you've either exhausted all possible
//! enum variants, or you explicitly opt-out of matching all variants, either
//! way, you can be much more confident that your code won't break if you add a
//! new state down the road, but forget to add it to a pattern match somewhere
//! deep inside your code-base.
//!
//! Finally, as per our declaration, we can transition this machine to the
//! `Unlocked` state by triggering the `TurnKey` event:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! # use Lock::*;
//! # let sm = Machine::new(Locked);
//! let sm = sm.event(TurnKey);
//! assert_eq!(sm.state(), Unlocked);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! #### A word about Type-Safety and Ownership
//!
//! It's important to realise that we've _consumed_ the original machine in the
//! above example, and got a newly initialised machine back in the `Unlocked`
//! state.
//!
//! This allows us to safely use the machine without having to worry about
//! multiple readers using the machine in different states.
//!
//! All these checks are applied on compile-time, so the following example would
//! fail to compile:
//!
//! ```rust,compile_fail
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! # use Lock::*;
//! # let sm = Machine::new(Locked);
//! let sm2 = sm.event(TurnKey);
//! assert_eq!(sm.state(), Locked);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This fails with the following compilation error:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0382]: use of moved value: `sm`
//!   --> src/lib.rs:140:12
//!    |
//! 14 | let sm2 = sm.event(TurnKey);
//!    |           -- value moved here
//! 15 | assert_eq!(sm.state(), Locked);
//!    |            ^^ value used here after move
//!    |
//!    = note: move occurs because `sm` has type `Lock::Machine<Lock::Locked>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
//! ```
//!
//! Similarly, we cannot execute undefined transitions, these are also caught by
//! the compiler:
//!
//! ```rust,compile_fail
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate sm;
//! # sm! {
//! #    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! #    TurnKey {
//! #        Locked => Unlocked
//! #        Unlocked => Locked
//! #    }
//! #
//! #    Break {
//! #        Locked => Broken
//! #        Unlocked => Broken
//! #    }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! # use Lock::*;
//! # let sm = Machine::new(Broken);
//! let sm = sm.event(TurnKey);
//! assert_eq!(sm.state(), Broken);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This fails with the following compilation error:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0599]: no method named `event` found for type `Lock::Machine<Lock::Broken>` in the current scope
//!   --> src/lib.rs:246:13
//!    |
//! 3  | / sm! {
//! 4  | |    Lock { Locked, Unlocked, Broken }
//! 5  | |    TurnKey {
//! 6  | |        Locked => Unlocked
//! ...  |
//! 13 | |    }
//! 14 | | }
//!    | |_- method `event` not found for this
//! ...
//! 19 |   let sm = sm.event(TurnKey);
//!    |               ^^^^^
//!    |
//!    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
//!    = note: the following trait defines an item `event`, perhaps you need to implement it:
//!            candidate #1: `Lock::Transition`
//!    = note: this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate (in Nightly builds, run with -Z external-macro-backtrace for more info)
//! ```
//!
//! The error message is not great (and can potentially be improved in the
//! future), but any error telling you `event` is not implemented, or the passed
//! in event type is invalid is an indication that you are trying to execute an
//! illegal state transition.
//!
//! #### The End ðŸ‘‹
//!
//! And that's it! There's nothing else to it, except a declarative â€“ and easy
//! to read â€“ state machine construction macro, and a type-safe and
//! ownership-focused way of dealing with states and transitions, without any
//! runtime overhead.
//!
//! **Go forth and transition!**
